				<h3>Hello, my name is .... and this is my short bio</h3> 
				<p>Currently I am studying at Douglas College in New Westminster. My upcoming Post-Degree diploma (Information and Communication Technology) offering a strong foundation in software engineering and programming principles across multiple platforms.</p>
				<p>Before I arrived to Canada I have been employed with Sela Software Labs as a software testing contractor for AT&amp;T Israel for five years. While working with AT&amp;T Israel I prepared test documentation: STP, STD and STR. I was responsible for preparation and maintenance of test environments: installation of Win clients in virtual environment, office installation, network configuration (client side), joining clients to domain, new exchange user creation and upgrade of testing software. I also have a working knowledge of SQL queries and manual testing of client side software.</p><p><a href='https://ca.linkedin.com/in/' target='_blank'>Linked-In</a></p>

			<div id="3dPrint">
			<h3>3D modeling and printing</h3>
			<p><span id='3dImg'></span>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. </p>
			<p>Thingiverse is a thriving design community for discovering, making, and sharing 3D printable things. As the world's largest 3D printing community.</p><p><a href='http://www.thingiverse.com/' target='_blank'>Thingiverse</a></p>

			<div id="alg">
			<h3>Algorithms</h3>
			<p>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.</p>
			<p>In this project included the following search algorithms:
			<ul><li class='notNav'> 
				Linear search
			</li><li class='notNav'>
				Binary search 
			</li></ul></p>
			<p>In this project included the following sorting algorithms:
			<ul>
				<li class='notNav'>Bubble sort</li>
				<li class='notNav'>Insertion sort</li>
				<li class='notNav'>Selection sort</li>
				<li class='notNav'>Quicksort</li>
				<li class='notNav'>Merge sort</li>

			<h3>Rosetta Code - my solution in JAVA</h3>
			<p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
			<p>Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site. The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another. Rosetta Code currently has 846 tasks, 198 draft tasks, and is aware of 648 languages, though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to every task in every language.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/ikostan/Rosetta_Code' target='_blank'>GitHub</a></p>

			<h3>DiceOut - Android game app</h3> 
			<p>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
			<p>The simulates rolling three dice and scoring a certain number of points for different combinations. There are three dice that appear in the middle and there is a Roll button that is customized with an image in the lower right corner.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/ikostan/DiceOut' target='_blank'>GitHub</a></p>
