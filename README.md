Simple JQuery app

### Question – Working with JQuery. 100%

In this assignment, you are required to produce one or more web pages that highlight an area of your
interest AND lets you showcase your knowledge of JQuery as well.

Although this assignment is pretty “loose” in its requirements TWO things are for sure.

1. You may NOT use a framework available on the web (or anywhere else) because that would
constitute plagiarism.

2. Your chosen theme should not resemble that of another student in the class. Let me explain.
Two students may coincidentally want to highlight their professional portfolio BUT unless the
two students “worked closely together”, there is very little likelihood that the final product will
resemble each other more than 50% of its “look and feel”. That is another reason why if you
“borrow” a framework from the web somewhere and the other student (whom you do not
even know) happens to “borrow” the same framework – well, we have a problem on our
hands.
